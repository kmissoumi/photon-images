### Training Plan

1. `LocalExecutionTest` shows off running locally

2. `SauceExecutionTest` shows the basics of running on Sauce Labs
    a. This uses the Sauce Bindings example straight from the website
    
3. `ExtraSauceTest` shows all of the main Sauce Labs specific values that can be used

4. `TestWatcherTest` shows sending passing & failing information to Sauce
    a. This uses SalsaVerde's `com.saucedemo.SauceTestWatcher` class

5. `SauceDemoTest` shows running an actual authentication test to look at commands list
    a. Note this is using SalsaVerde syntax

6. `ExtendedDebuggingTest` - Sets Extended debugging values to show in UI

7. `SauceConnectTest` - kick off a tunnel locally and show the sub-account:
    a. Expects these sc flags: `--tunnel-identifier ORANGE --shared-tunnel --no-remove-colliding-tunnels --pidfile /tmp/pid0.log'`
    b. Requires overriding Sauce Bindings defaults with different username/access key values
